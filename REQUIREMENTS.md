# Mini Java Application - Customer REST API

### Instructions

We will need a new Java app to read in a CSV file from a directory. The contents will then need to be sent to a REST API endpoint, in JSON format, and saved to a SQL database.

1. Create a console app to read in a CSV file from a directory.
2. Parse the CSV file of which the contents are:
   * Customer Ref
   * Customer Name
   * Address Line 1
   * Address Line 2
   * Town
   * County
   * Country
   * Postcode
3. Loop through the rows of the CSV file and send each row to a REST API POST endpoint, in JSON format.
4. The REST API should then save the content to a database table. Format can match the CSV file.
5. Create a REST API GET endpoint to retrieve the customer information, passing in a customer ref to filter the data. Contents should be returned in JSON format.
6. Some documentation or Wiki to explain the approach taken.

Where possible, a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach should be taken.
